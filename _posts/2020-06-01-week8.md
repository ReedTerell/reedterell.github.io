title: Week 8
---
By Week 8, the project was almost complete. I identified some areas where adjustments could enhance the performance and responsiveness, so I made the necessary changes. Now, we reached the  stage of deploying the application to an actual device. As a team, we needed to decide whether to build it for Android or iPhone. While sharing our ideas, we kept in mind some essential principles for device-specific application development. For instance, we were aware that building an iOS app on a Windows computer would not be possible unless, we used an virtual machine. Considering this, and since I could work with Android on my Windows computer, we decided to proceed with building the application for Android. To begin the Android development, I required an Android device, and my mentor assisted me in obtaining one along with all the necessary resources. I started building the application, ensuring proper image target positioning and scaling to avoid any negative impact with functionality.
