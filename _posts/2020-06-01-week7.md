title: Week 7

In Week 7, continuing with our regular weekly meetings, the overall progress of the project remained great. During one of these sessions, we decided to prioritize the AI aspect and proposed a script revision to ensure that students not only grasp the material we aim to teach but also have the ability to ask meaningful questions. After configuring the AI accordingly, I reached out to SCRO Lab (Semiconductor Career Readiness Organization) to gather their feedback on the script. Incorporating their input, I made more adjustments to the script.
