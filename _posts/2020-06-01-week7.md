In Week 5, I successfully integrated AI into the program by writing a script to program the AI. I met with the SCRO Lab and presented the script, and they confirmed its accuracy. Having gained firsthand experience with the processes, I made additional additions to the scene to replicate them. Furthermore, I am conducting research on videos that explain photolithography. The plan is to embed these videos into the scene to create a more immersive learning experience.
