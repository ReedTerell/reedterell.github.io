For the third week, I presented my first demo, the mentors were satisified with the progress made. The demo showed the spin coater, as well as an informational symbol that was still in development. The purpose of the informational symbol is to integrate gaze interaction within Unity. When a person looks at an object, a pop-up will appear, providing an explanation of what it represents. My teammate and I also compiled a list of necessary items for the project, such as an Arduino, which will enable us to capture input and output it into Unity, simulating the parameters for an actual spin coater.
