During the first week, I met with my mentors to discuss the project in detail and gained a understanding of its requirements. Following that, I dedicated my time to conducting extensive research. I focused on identifying the essential elements needed to create the AR experience, involving exploring resources related to AR development and semiconductor processes, as well as reading related literature to deepen my understanding, allowing me to build a strong foundation for planning and implementations for the following weeks.
