In Week 4, I successfully implemented keyboard functionalities that will be transferred to the Arduino for program control. These buttons enable simulation of the photolithography process, including the use of a dropper and the spinning of the wafer in the scene. For Week 5, I have planned to meet with the SCRO Lab at the University of Florida. These students have a interest in the field and have access to the cleanroom lab on campus. By joining them, I will have the opportunity to observe the processes firsthand and present a demo to ensure accuracy.
