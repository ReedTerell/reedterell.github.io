During the first week, I had the opportunity to meet my mentors who provided a detailed explanation of the project. Once we were aligned on the project requirements, I began my work by conducting research to create a solid game plan for the upcoming weeks. It was decided that we would utilize Unity and Vuforia for image tracking. I successfully found suitable 3D models representing the nanotechnology elements and integrated them into the AR environment. Additionally, I incorporated an LCD display within the scene to showcase the customizable settings for the spin coater.
