Description: Develop a machine-learning model to identify the species and morphology of fossil shark teeth using a dataset from the Florida Museum of Natural History. Co-supervised by Dr. Christan Grant and his graduate student. Sponsored by the National Science Foundation (NSF) Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) program.

MR for Semiconductor Fab Labs:
